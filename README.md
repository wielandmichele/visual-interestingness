# visual-interestingness
I'm lucky to be involved in Fitim's PhD research at ZHAW. My work primarily focuses on identifying visually interesting features that are not influenced by the specific social media platform or the theme of the images. To achieve this, I employ various clustering techniques and utilize Gradient Reversal to unlearn certain characteristics.
